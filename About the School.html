                          <h3>Brief Historical Background</h3>
                          <p>
                            The Evelio Javier Memorial National High School was among the old barangay schools in the 
                            country that were nationatlized by virtue of Executive Order 189 signed by then president 
                            Corazon C. Aquino on June 10, 1987. Under this Executive Order, the operations and funding of 
                            these old barangay high schools, particularly the salaries and 
                            compensation of teachers, were placed under the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS),
                            now DEPED.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Under Section 1 of E0 189, it provides that all public secondary school teachers are placed under the
                            administrative supervision and contorol of the Department of Education Culture and Sprts.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Henceforth, basic salaries and cost of living allowances of said teachers shall be paid by the national government.

                          <h3>Pre-Executive Order 189</h3>
                          <p>
                            Prior to the promulgation of Executive Order 189, the school existed as Camp 6 Barangay High School since June 18, 1982. The establishment of a high school here was the offshoot of the efforts and initiatives of Mr. Julio Palispis, then the principal of Benguet Exploration Elementary school, and other Stakeholders, who saw the need of establishing a high school in this mining community. Camp 6 was the site operation of the defunct Benguet Exploration, which attracted the settlements here of workers and other migrants from the Cordilleras and the lowlands.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Together with Mr. Calaycay, then Camp 4 Barangay Secretary. Mr. Palispis led the negotiation with the management of Benguet exploration for the opening of a barangay high school in Camp 6.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The efforts of the duo and other stakeholders got positive results when the mining accompany agreed to construct the first school building while the Municipal Government of Tuba subsidized the salaries of the first teachers. From 1928 to 1986, the management of the barangay high school was integrated with the elementary school. Both Schools had one school head during that time.

                          <p>Since graduating from university, I have also undertaken responsibilities for designing a product for the company. The roles I have been given have provided the perfect opportunity to implement the skills I have gained throughout my higher
                            education, as well as experiencing the running of a successful business.</p>

                          <h3>After-Executive Order 189 (Hons)</h3>
                          <p>EJNMHS gained its independence on June 19, 1987 allowing it to have its own school head but the graduation ceremonies, major school activities and faculty meetings were still merged with the Benguet Exploration Elementary School. It was not until 1997 when it had its own graduation ceremonies.

                          <h3>EJMNHS (Main)</h3>
                          <p>Formerly known as Camp 6 Barangay High School, the name of the school was changed in 1987 into Evelio Javier Memorial National High School in honor of the Evelio Javier, the late Governor of antique province as well as stockholder of the Benguet Exploration Mining Incorporated. He was assassinated due to political gimmickry in the aftermath of the 1986 Presidential snap election, which prompted his sister Nona Javier, the treasurer of Benguet Exploration Mining Incorporated to name the school after him.</p>

                          <h3>The School Circumstances</h3>
                          <p>The residents of Camp 6 found out later that the mining corporation secretly deducted from the salaries of its employees the expenses it incurred from constructing the first two story building here. Due to bankruptcy and mismanagement, the corporation ceased operation in 1990, leaving significant legacies for the school. For purposes of community identity and to avoid confusion as to the exact location of the school, legal process is currently being undertaken to change the name of the school as Camp 6 National High School. At present, there is also a high school in Remegio, Antique known as Governor Evelio Memorial National High School, adding more to this confusion.</p>
